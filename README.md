# MINSK
Our project for SOEN 6611: Software Measurement in Summer 2016 is titled MINSK. The project involves developing program for three mathematical equations: the quadratic equation, cubic equation and a function to find primality of a number from software engineering perspective. Specialized goals of this project include ensuring presence of quality attributes such as coding style, optimal Cyclomatic complexity and measure various aspects of the programs.
